## Business Task

A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a â€‹murderâ€‹ that occurred sometime on â€‹Jan.15, 2018â€‹ and that it took place in â€‹SQL Cityâ€‹. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police departmentâ€™s database.

First, I want to get a sense of the database structure and how everything connects.

## Question and Solution
Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police departmentâ€™s database.

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM crime_scene_report 
WHERE date = 20180115
AND type = 'murder'
AND city = 'SQL City';
```           

First witness
```SQL
SELECT *
FROM person
WHERE address_street_name = "Northwestern Dr"
ORDER BY address_number DESC
LIMIT 1;
```  


Second Witness
```SQL
SELECT *
FROM person
WHERE address_street_name = "Franklin Ave"
AND name LIKE "Annabel%";
```  

Interview Transcripts
```SQL
SELECT *
FROM interview
WHERE person_id = 14887
OR person_id = 16371;
```

Gym member with id and check-in date
```SQL              
SELECT gm.id, gm.name 
FROM get_fit_now_member gm
JOIN get_fit_now_check_in gc
ON gm.id = gc.membership_id
WHERE gm.id LIKE "48Z%" 
AND gc.check_in_date = 20180109;
```

```SQL
SELECT p.name, dl.plate_number
FROM person p
JOIN drivers_license dl
ON p.license_id = dl.id
WHERE p.name = "Joe Germuska" OR p.name = "Jeremy Bowers";
```

Check Solution
```SQL
INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Jeremy Bowers');
        SELECT value FROM solution;
```

Find real villain
```SQL
SELECT p.name, i.transcript
FROM person p
JOIN interview i
ON p.id = i.person_id
WHERE p.name = "Jeremy Bowers";
```

```SQL
SELECT p.name, dl.height, dl.hair_color, fb.event_name, fb.date
FROM person p
JOIN drivers_license dl
ON p.license_id = dl.id
JOIN facebook_event_checkin fb
ON p.id = fb.person_id
WHERE fb.event_name LIKE "SQL%"
AND dl.hair_color = "red"
AND dl.car_make = "Tesla";
```


```SQL
INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Miranda Priestly');
        SELECT value FROM solution;
```
